# IPC Project Water Quality Analysis Using Arduino Uno and C programming language

The project presents a real-time Arduino-based water quality monitoring system designed to detect pollution levels by measuring parameters such as **pH, temperature, and conductivity**. Traditional water testing methods are time-consuming and require laboratory equipment, whereas this automated system enables continuous and remote monitoring. The project utilizes **Arduino UNO, pH sensors, temperature sensors, and a GSM module to process data and send alerts when water quality falls below acceptable thresholds.**

The system integrates hardware components (sensors, microcontroller, and GSM module) with software programming in C, using an Arduino IDE for coding and debugging. The collected data is processed and transmitted to authorized personnel via SMS alerts, ensuring proactive pollution control.

Challenges faced include the high cost of sensors, complex coding requirements, and balancing project work with academics. 

The project concludes that real-time water quality monitoring is **cost-effective, flexible, and reliable**, reducing the need for manual testing while ensuring safe drinking water and environmental sustainability.
